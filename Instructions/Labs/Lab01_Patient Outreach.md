# Module 4 Lesson 1- Lab 1: Patient Outreach


## Overview

The **Patient Outreach** application in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare focuses on patient campaign management, which helps you organize and automate marketing and communicate with patients. It helps healthcare providers reach out to their communities and patients in a targeted, efficient way. Providers can choose email, text, regular mail, or a combination, to provide healthcare information to specific groups of patients and community members.

The Patient Outreach application in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare allows healthcare providers to communicate with their communities and patients in a targeted, efficient way. Patient Outreach is a patient campaign management application that helps you organize and automate marketing and outreach to patients. The application allows you to orchestrate personalized journeys across patient touchpoints to strengthen relationships and increase patient retention and thus improving care.

Key capabilities of **Patient Outreach** include:

-   **Patient segmentation** - Prebuilt patient segments are based on the industry
    standard Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to
    provide baseline patient cohorts.

-   **Patient engagement campaigns** - Create healthcare-specific email campaigns
    that use patient segments based on the HEDIS industry standard.

-   **Event management** - Use provider and payer event management templates for
    event administration and registration.

-   **Trigger-based journeys** - Allow patient journeys to initiate based on a condition and enable faster reactions to patient interactions and changes. Trigger journeys are based on real-world interactions such as checking in for an appointment or being discharged from the hospital.

Patient Outreach focuses on the Deliver exceptional patient and member experiences priority scenario by creating personalized communication based on patient insights

This lab focuses on the healthcare story of Elizabeth Moore.

![image](./IMAGES/image2.png)

At an annual checkup earlier this year, Elizabeth is diagnosed with hypermetropia, a common eye condition in adults in which nearby objects are blurry. Lamna Healthcare Company has seen a recent influx of patients who want to be more educated on hypermetropia. Lamna has decided to increase their patient outreach efforts by hosting a virtual marketing event.

In this module, you'll play the role of a Lamna Healthcare Company marketing administrator and will use the Patient Outreach capabilities in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare to walk through the following exercises:

1.	Create a patient segment to group patients based off a similar characteristic.
2.	Create a marketing email for outreach to patients in the defined segment.
3.	Create a patient journey using the designer to send the marketing email to everyone in the patient segment.
4.	Create a virtual marketing event to track the attendees and details of the event.
5.	Create a trigger and use this to trigger a patient journey.

## Exercise 1: Create a Patient Segment

In this exercise, you'll create a patient segment by using the Patient Outreach app in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. You can use a patient segment to group patients into cohorts based on similar characteristics so that they can be better targeted with marketing communications. In this example, you'll create a patient segment for patients with hypermetropia (a vision condition in which nearby objects appear blurry).

1.  Navigate to https://make.powerapps.com/ and log into your Microsoft 365 tenant, if needed.

1.  If needed, change the environment on the top right corner of the Power apps home page.

A patient journey can expand your organization's patient outreach marketing capabilities by helping healthcare organizations guide the members of a selected segment through the communication process. It completes this action by using automated messaging, activity generation, interactive decision points, and more.

The following screenshot shows an example of a configured patient journey that focuses on the Patient Activation Measure segment group and sends them a marketing email after a three-month waiting period.

This information will become available at a time that is based on the date and time that you chose for the start of the customer journey. You can return to view the results later if they aren't yet available.

You've created a patient journey that will send the invitation email to the Healthy Eye Seminar to members of the Patients with Hypermetropia segment. For more information on patient journeys, see Create a simple customer journey (Dynamics 365 Marketing).


## Exercise 4: Create a Virtual Healthcare Educational Event
