# Module 4 Lesson 1- Lab 2A: Azure Health Bot

## Overview

The Microsoft Azure Health Bot service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy their AI-powered, compliant, conversational healthcare experiences at scale. It allows businesses to offer your users intelligent and personalized access to health-related information and interactions through a natural conversation experience.

With the service, healthcare organizations can build a health bot instance and integrate it with their systems that patients, nurses, doctors, and other representatives can interact with. Building an instance allows you to improve processes, services, outcomes, and cost.

Azure Health Bot service contains a built-in medical database, including triage protocols. You can also extend a health bot instance to include your own scenarios and integrate with other IT systems and data sources To learn more about Azure Health Bot, see [Azure Health Bot Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/health-bot/) on Microsoft Docs.

## Industry prioritized scenarios

Azure Health Bot focuses on the Enhance patient engagement priority scenario by creating a virtual bot health option to allow for new avenues of care with embedded insights.

### Task: Obtain an Azure application ID

In this task, you'll be using the Azure application ID that you created in your Azure tenant during environment preparation. You might have called it "**MCH Application ID**". Registering this ID established a trusted relationship between your Dynamics 365 app and the Microsoft identity platform.
You'll now obtain the client ID and store it to later create a Dynamics 365 application user to bridge the authentication between Azure Health Bot and Microsoft Power Apps.

1.	Return to the Azure portal and search for **App registrations** in the search box. Select the **App registrations** service.
