# Module 4 Lesson 2 Lab 6: Virtual Visits

## Overview

Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare's virtual health allows clinicians to use video conferencing to provide high-quality, personalized, and affordable consultations. Using the entire meetings platform in Microsoft Teams, providers can schedule, manage, and conduct virtual consultation with patients. With the Microsoft Teams integration, practitioners get a full view of their patient's information and history.

Virtual Care focuses on the **Deliver Exceptional Patient experiences** and **Foster health team collaboration** priority scenario by providing a virtual health solution for scheduling and following up on virtual visits between patients, providers, and care managers.

This lab will focus on the healthcare story of Reed Flores.

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image2.png)


After coming home from hiking, Reed noticed he had a new rash on his right leg. He decides to schedule a virtual appointment to get a diagnosis.

In this lab, you will first play the role of a Lamna Healthcare system administrator by configuring the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare Virtual Clinic application to be used for virtual appointments. Then, you will play the role of Reed Flores by scheduling a virtual appointment with his practitioner, Alex Johnson. Finally, you will join the virtual appointment from the view of a practitioner to observe the complete end-to-end experience.

## Exercise 1: Configure Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare for virtual visits

In this exercise, you will configure the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare Virtual Clinic application. The Virtual Clinic application allows practitioners to use video conferencing in Microsoft Teams to provide high-quality, personalized, and affordable consultations for their patients.

## Task: Create a new Codeable Concept for practitioner specialty type

In this task, you’ll create a new Codeable Concept of type **practitioner specialty** to use on the **Patient Portal**. Practitioner specialty is used to define a reason why a patient is booking the virtual appointment.

As the first step in the booking process, the user must select a reason, which includes the practitioners' specialties.

**Note** - The Codeable Concept is one of the most important data items in HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and is defined in the FHIR specification as a value that is usually supplied by providing a reference to one or more terminologies or ontologies, but may also be defined by the provision of text. Practitioner covers all individuals who are engaged in the healthcare process and healthcare-related services as part of their formal responsibilities and this resource is used for attribution of activities and responsibilities to these individuals.Practitioners include (but are not limited to):

 •	physicians, dentists, pharmacists

 •	physician assistants, nurses, scribes

 •	midwives, dietitians, therapists, optometrists, paramedics

 •	medical technicians, laboratory scientists, prosthetic technicians, radiographers

 •	social workers, professional homecare providers, official volunteers

 •	receptionists handling patient registration

 •	IT personnel merging or unmerging patient records

 •	Service animal (for example, ward assigned dog capable of detecting cancer in patients)

Following is an example of the appointment booking screen in the Patient Portal, which displays the practitioner’s specialties defined as Codeable Concepts.

For an entity that isn’t shown directly on an application’s navigation, you can add a new record for those entities through Power Apps. To create a new practitioner specialty, you’ll create a new Codeable Concept record through Power Apps.

1.	While signed into your Microsoft 365 tenant, open a new tab, and go to Microsoft Power Apps. Select your environment.

2.	On the left navigation pane, select **Tables**.

3.	In the right pane, select **All** tables.

4.	Use the search box in the upper right corner to search for the string **codeable**.

5.	Select the **Codeable Concept** table from the search results and then select Edit.
 
![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image4.png)

6.	Select **+New** **row** dropdown and then select **New row using form.**

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image5.png)

7.	In the **New Codable Concept** form, fill in the following details.

    o	**Name** - General Medicine

    o	**Text** - General Medicine

    o	**Type** - Practitioner Specialty

    o	**Code** – general

    o	Select **Save & Close**

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image6.png)

8.	After saving and closing the new **Codeable Concepts** form, select **Done** on the **Currently adding a new row** pop-up to refresh the **Codeable Concepts** table.

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image7.png) 

9.	Once the **Codeable Concepts** table is refreshed, select the **Name** column, and then select **Filter by.**

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image8.png) 

10.	In the **Filter by** pane, use the below expression and select **Apply**.

    o	**Operator**: Contains

    o	**Value**: General

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image9.png) 

11.	You can now verify that a new codeable concept of type **Practitioner** **Specialty** is successfully created.

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image10.png) 

You've created a new practitioner specialty that will now be available for selection as an appointment visit reason in the Patient Portal.

### Task : Create a new Practitioner's schedule

In this task, you'll configure the practitioner's schedule to allow patients to book appointments with them in the Patient Portal.

1.	While on [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), on the left navigation pane, select **Tables**.

You've enabled a practitioner's schedule to be used for booking virtual appointments.

## Task: Configure slots for appointments

In this task, you'll configure a new appointment slot to show practitioner's availability.

![image](./IMAGES/Lab06/image16.png)

You've created a new virtual slot for Reed to book with the practitioner, Alex Johnson.

### Task : Configure Mapped System User on Practitioner Record

In this task, you'll configure the Mapped System User field on the Practitioner record. This field should be set to the system user that maps to the contact record. Set this field to our logged-in user record.

-   In the case of virtual appointments, the Teams meeting is created on the mapped user’s calendar.
-   In the case of instant virtual appointments, the Teams meeting is created on the Organizer (organizer email for virtual appointments) specified in the Admin settings.

1.  Launch the Healthcare Administration app from power apps. Select **Practitioners** on the left navigation pane.

2.	Select the **Alex Johnson** record and select **Edit**.

## Exercise 2: Configure Microsoft Teams for Virtual Visits

In this exercise, you will configure integration with Microsoft Teams for Lamna Healthcare Company. Microsoft Teams offers several features useful for hospitals and other healthcare organizations. By integrating Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare with Microsoft Teams, you can improve the collaboration between your care team staff and enhance patient care. You can quickly schedule and conduct virtual visits remotely with patients.

Additionally, your care team can use Microsoft Teams internally to do the following:

-   Chat, call, post messages, and communicate as a team.

-   Store and share files and documents to collaborate.

-   Use Shifts to create, manage, and share schedules among your staff.
